The raw data file contains the measurements from a study recording the daily activity of 30 test subjects, ages 19-48 years old. The data was collected using the accelerometer and gyroscope from a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) attached to the waist. Activities tracked: walking, walking up stairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.

Go to the study link above to download the data, and for the full description data set.

See Codebook in this repository for detailed list of variables of this analysis and the resulting tidy data set.
